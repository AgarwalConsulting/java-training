# Gilded Rose Challenge

Download code from [here](https://github.com/crispab/bdd-kata).

As part of this challenge, you will be be writing `Scenarios` & `Step definitions` for existing implementation. You will also add spec for new features of 'Conjured' items, before you implement it. As always, refactor when you have sufficient code coverage.
